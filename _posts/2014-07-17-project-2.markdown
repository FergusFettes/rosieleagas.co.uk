  I first moved to Aberdeenshire to study Zoology at the University of Aberdeen. During my studies I was a volunteer worker at Haddo house.
  This was to be the start of a long relationship with the nature, farmland, and tourism of Aberdeenshire.
  In the last years, I have been running the cafe in Leith Hall, producing delicious healthy food in part from locally grown, organic ingredients.

  After university, I moved with my young family to Gardenstown on the north coast. There I ran the villiage pub and restaurant, preparing meals with fish, prawns and crabs sourced directly from local fishermen, who would carry them up from the harbour in a bucket.
  In Gardenstown I learned more about the importance of hospitality and tourism to the region, as well as the fishing industry that forms the great compliment to the fertile farming in the region.

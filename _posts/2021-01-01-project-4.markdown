  Soon after my daughter moved home to work on the farm, she became the manager of Leith Hall. There I started running the cafe, using vegetables grown in the Hall Gardens and products from our farm.
  At the same time, we started doing a monthly stall at Huntly Farmers market, selling local organically grown vegetables at affordable prices. Perhaps you have met me there!

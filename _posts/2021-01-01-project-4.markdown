  Soon after my daughter moved home to work on the farm, she became the manager of Leith Hall. There I started running the cafe, using vegetables grown in the Hall Gardens and products from our farm.
  At the same time, we started doing a monthly stall at Huntly Farmers market, selling local organically grown vegetables at affordable prices. Perhaps you have met me there!
  The farm enterprise is currently taking part in a business accelerator programme run the Robert Gordons Univeristy in Aberdeen. Through this, we are learning how to creat a successful business in a rural economy that can make a positive difference to the climate, peoples diets, and ultimately peoples lives.
